# Telegram <--> Website

A dead simple telegram bot script to update bookmark links in my personal website and trigger automated deploys.

## Why? 

Because manual process takes time!

## How to run this?
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
